Must have Python installed on PC and a python IDE. This program takes in two lists, the x lists represent job rank in a company with rank 1 being the lowest and rank 10 being the highest. The y list represents the salary earned for each job rank. The x and y data are used to create a linear regression model as well as a polynomial regression model. The data points are plotted onto a scatter plot, with the line of best for the linear regression and polynomial regression models plotted onto the scatter plot. The coefficients of the polynomial model are also printed out and predictions can be made with the model.
